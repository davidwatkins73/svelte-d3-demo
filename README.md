## Svelte D3 Demos

This is just a playground site, non of the code is ever intended for release/production. I'm only using it as a place to learn more about Svelte and D3.


**Note:** Project started via https://github.com/sveltejs/template.


## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd svelte-d3-demo
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.


## Deploying to the web

### With [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Install `vercel` if you haven't already:

```bash
npm install -g vercel
```

Then, from within your project folder:

```bash

vercel deploy --name my-project
```

### With [surge](https://surge.sh/)

Install `surge` if you haven't already:

```bash

Then, from within your project folder:
